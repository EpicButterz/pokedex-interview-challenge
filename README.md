# Pokedex Interview Challange

Welcome to the Pokedex Interview Challenge! This challenge hopes to test your basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by having you interact with the Pokemon pokeapi.

## Instructions

clone this repository

```
https://github.com/EpicButterz/pokedex-interview-challenge.git
```

cd into the `pokedex-interview-challenge` directory and:

```
npm install
```

Start your dev environment

```
npm run serve
```

In no particular order:

- Create a paginated table that will display Pokemon numbers, image (sprite), and names. (Bonus! Show more details about the pokemon when clicked)
- Style the page so that it doesn't look like it's from 1995 (Bonus! Make the layout pretty. Use newer featuers like flexbox and css grid layout. Also, if there is time remaining, make it responsive)
- Interact with the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co) to get pokemon data and then display it

Your app should be fully functional by the end of the interview. Make sure to work out functionality first and then work on bonuses after.

## Pokeapi

Pokeapi documentation can be found here: https://pokeapi.co/docsv2

You are allowed to use whatever libraries you like in this challenge.

Hint: to get a list of 20 pokemon use this call:

```
http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&offset=0
```

## Good luck!

Interviewing sucks. Hopefully this can be a fun challenge that shows off actual web dev skills. Please leave an issue with any suggestions!
